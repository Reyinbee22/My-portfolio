    <h1> <U> BIO </U>></h1>
<P> My name is Bassey Wealth Idoreyin. 
    I am an alumni of Lagos State university.
    I majored in Medical Lab sci..
    I am came out with a second class upper 
    in the year 2022. 
    I am a passionate fullstack software developer 
    with a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies. 
    My journey in web development started when I built my first website using HTML and CSS,
    and I have been hooked ever since.
    I am a hard-working and driven individual who isn't afraid to face a challenge. 
    I know how to get the job done. 
    I would describe myself as an open and honest person who doesn't believe in misleading other people 
    and tries to be fair in everything I do. 
    I think some of my strengths would be my independence,
    calmness, and kindness. 
    I like being independent,
    and I hate depending on others for things.
    I have worked with two top companies so far , 
    my experience there was very challenging but fun. </P>
